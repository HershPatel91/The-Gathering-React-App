## The Gathering

The are more than one million apartments in the New York City Area. It is the most predominant form of real estate in the city. However, there is no way to easily access apartments for social gatherings outside of one's firend circle. The Gathering is a social platform enabling NYC party-goers to browse and access apartment parties across the city. The Gathering events are unique with themed parties focused on types of music, careers, hobbies, and personalities. Members of a Gathering event will also have visibility on their fellow attendees allowing approved members to message other attendees, start a group chat, etc to get to know their company for the event beforehand. The Gathering aims to remove the amibiguity of going out in NYC, providing a venue to socializing with new friends instead of random strangers. 

## Technical Stack

The Gathering is built on a Rails Back End API and a React Front End. The application will also include map functionality through Google Maps and Facebook Authentication.
