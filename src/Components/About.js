      <h3 className="about">The Gathering is a social platform enabling NYC party-goers to browse and access apartment parties across the city. The Gathering events are unique with themed parties focused on types of music, careers, hobbies, and personalities. Members of a Gathering event will also have visibility on their fellow attendees allowing approved members to message other attendees, start a group chat, etc to get to know their company for the event beforehand. The Gathering aims to remove the amibiguity of going out in NYC, providing a venue to socialize with new friends instead of unknown strangers.</h3>
